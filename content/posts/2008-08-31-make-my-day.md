This may sound kind of trite but I think if you can find one or two things that &#8216;make your day&#8217; every day, then you will have an enjoyable life. For example some people left comments on a post I made on another blog and it just left me with a feeling of being noticed, of not crying into the empty void&#8230; that every bit of acknowledgement makes a difference.

Have one or two of those moments a day and life seems more worthwhile- make up your own, it doesn&#8217;t have to be a blog post- could be that you finally hypnotised a chicken for the first time.

The argument against it would be that just &#8216;settling&#8217; for a nice moment or two a day would take away any ambition for larger achievements, and I would agree, but I find one only gets those moments of satisfaction, of &#8216;having one&#8217;s day made&#8217; if one&#8217;s life overall IS reaching for the bigger picture, the larger goal, whatever that may be&#8230; possibly hypnotising an ostrich, or a member of the US Congress. Reaching for the ambitious is the background, the soil if you will, in which these day to day satisfactions grow. 

Just a thought, now leave me a comment and make my day ðŸ˜‰
