> **&#8230;to a friend who had suffered the loss of a young child:**
> 
> <span><span><span>Dear Adam,</span></span></span>
> 
> <span><span><span>I am sorry you are so miserable. “Depression” means literally “being forced downward.” This can happen even when you don’t consciously have any feeling at all of being “on top.” So I wouldn’t dismiss this hypothesis out of hand …<br /> </span></span></span>
> 
> <span><span><span>I would seek out one or two people who seemed amiable and would make myself useful to them … I would raise animals and plants and find joy in their thriving. I would surround myself with beauty —- no matter how primitive and artless —- objects, colors, sounds. I would eat and drink well.<br /> </span></span></span>
> 
> <span><span><span>When the darkness grows denser, I would penetrate to its very core and ground, and would not rest until amid the pain an light appeared to me, for <em>in excessu affectus</em> Nature reverses herself. I would turn in rage against myself and with the heat of my rage I would melt my lead. I would renounce everything and engage in the lowest activities should my depression drive me to violence. I would wrestle with the dark angel until he dislocated my hip. For he is also the light and the blue sky which he withholds from me.<br /> </span></span></span>
> 
> <span><span><span>Anyway, that is what I would do. What others would do is another question, which I cannot answer. But for you too there is an instinct either to back out of it or to go down to the depths. But no half-measures or half-heartedness.</span></span></span>
> 
> <span><span><span>With cordial wishes,</span></span></span>
  
> <span><span><span>As ever, C.G.Jung</span></span></span>
