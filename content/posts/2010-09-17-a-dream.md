Dream: i heard a noise coming out of the bean bag. i undid the zip- i sensed that this was the place all my songs came from. out came a big black spider, which started spinning a web. the spider changed into a panther with strong piercing eyes. i was repulsed by the spider, but was less afraid of the panther. i put my hand out, and it jumped at it, but more playfully than anything. it cuddled my arm in the way cats do when they&#8217;re play-fighting. in the morning i found a large spider in the flat, the first one i&#8217;ve ever found in here. i flattened it.
