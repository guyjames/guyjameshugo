nothing is sacred
  
look above the clouds
  
the wind blows in the space between you and the distant stars
  
nothing is sacred&#8230; no one knows where it will go
  
the wind is silent until it touches you
  
you are part of the wind
  
the stars are in your brain
  
a black hole in your brain
  
nothing is sacred&#8230; no one knows how long
  
the sun is cold until it touches you
  
you are incandescent
  
you are the space between the notes
  
the distance is in your brain
  
you are part of the sun
  
nothing is sacred
