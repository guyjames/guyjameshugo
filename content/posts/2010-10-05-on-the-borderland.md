Who is the third who walks always beside you?
  
When I count, there are only you and I together
  
But when I look ahead up the white road
  
There is always another one walking beside you
  
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
  
I do not know whether a man or a woman
  
—But who is that on the other side of you?

—T.S. Eliot, from The Waste Land, 1922.
