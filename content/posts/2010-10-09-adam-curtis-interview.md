&#8220;What they need to do is take the internet, and instead of portraying it as some sort of platform in which they just show people&#8217;s dogs falling down stairs, they should use this and find a way of imaginatively constructing new things out of it. It&#8217;ll be complicated, because the internet is quite anti-narrative, it goes all over the shop, but I know full well someone somewhere will take that and turn it into something like a Dickens novel, and use it to take people out of themselves. And I tell you, there&#8217;s no one at the BBC thinking like that. And it&#8217;s about time they did. &#8221; &#8211; <a title="Adam Curtis" href="http://tinyurl.com/3xmlxgj" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/3xmlxgj</a>
