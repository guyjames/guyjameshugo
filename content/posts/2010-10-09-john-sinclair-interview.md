&#8220;SINCLAIR: Thats exactly what it is: unity of government, industry and the banks. And no one is doing better right now than the banks. Because they had that deficit down, you see? The banks cant make any money without a deficit. So now they&#8217;ve got the biggest deficit of all time! So that means theyre just shoveling millions and billions of dollars into the banks in interest. I havent read my paper yet today, but maybe they&#8217;ve taken the prime rate down to 1/2 or 3/4 of a percent. Can you imagine how much money theyre making on that? To buy money for half a percent and sell it to you for, you know, whatever. If its a credit card company they&#8217;re selling it to you for 29%! I mean, those are UNBELIEVABLE profits. &#8221;
