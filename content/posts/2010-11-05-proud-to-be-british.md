The only time I&#8217;ve *really* felt proud to be British in recent times was watching the recent Bill Hicks documentary. In the USA Bill was playing tiny clubs and people just didn&#8217;t &#8216;get&#8217; him. He came to the UK and was soon selling out the 4,000 seater Dominion Theatre in London. His relief at finally being understood makes me proud of our &#8216;black&#8217; sense of humour.
