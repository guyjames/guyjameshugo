&#8220;Lee & Shlain, in their book Acid Dreams, relate that on one occasion “a journalist from the Saturday Evening Post dropped by the [Diggers&#8217;] Free Store and asked to speak with the manager. He was told that the manager was a shy person who didn’t like to answer questions but would make an exception in this instance. The man from the Post was then introduced to a Newsweek reporter who had been told the same thing. The two press stiffs questioned each other in a corner for twenty minutes before discovering that they’d been duped.”
