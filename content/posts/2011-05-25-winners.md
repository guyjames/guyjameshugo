&#8220;O gifted men, vainglorious for first place,
  
how short a time the laurel crown stays green
  
&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..
  
A breath of wind is all there is to fame
  
here upon earth: it blows this way and that,
  
and when it changes quarter it changes name.&#8221;

&#8211; Dante.

It&#8217;s a shame that the winner in Formula 1 no longer gets a laurel wreath like they used to. Perhaps because we have forgotten that success is inherently transient.
