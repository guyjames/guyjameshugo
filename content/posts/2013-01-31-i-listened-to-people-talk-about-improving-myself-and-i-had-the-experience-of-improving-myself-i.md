I listened to people talk about improving myself and i had the experience of improving myself

I listened to people speak about their God as if theirs was the only true God and i was lost without it

I listened to people talk about oneness and no self and had that experience too

I listened to people talk about having a quiet mind and had the experience of a quiet mind

I listened to people tell me that awareness is what remains as everything comes and goes

I listened to people talk about a realization beyond all ideas and i took that idea on for awhile

All of those ideas and realizations were remarkable only because they all shared the same characteristic. They dont last

What did i discover through all of that? I discovered that im better off not listening to other people so much, that i had been listening to second hand knowledge, that i had become addicted to trying to discover the truth or have it reflected back to me through the words of others. Join me in this sobriety where no one can speak for you anymore, and no one has anything that you dont except for some fancy spiritual words that sound as if the world is made up of haves and have nots. Notice that when you aspire to follow second hand knowledge it feels as if you are one of the have nots. Notice that when you espouse what sounds like second hand knowledge to others, it looks like you are one of the haves. Why settle for these tricks of the mind?

Be free and find that freedom for yourself in whatever way that shows up. If everyone trusts his or her own exoerience, the world of haves and have nots doesnt last either. And if you read this post as more second hand knowledge, dont worry, that wont last either.
