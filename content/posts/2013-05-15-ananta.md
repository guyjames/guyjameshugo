The endless sweep of the horizon
  
From my window seat, the sea
  
Gazing past the concrete holiday boxes
  
Today the wind is fierce
  
A hulk with two cranes shelters distantly in the bay
  
Overpowering banks of light trained on the shore
  
Pin points as
  
The sun sinks into the grey beyond

The steel sides groan against the waves
  
Its lights now become the sun
  
We can only know the endless by that which seems to end
  
The great ship made tiny by the sea
  
But where do I end and the waves begin?

In my dream I saw the same ship before now
  
Lashed by terrible storms
  
The empty vessel facing a grey sky alone
  
Like the boat in my mother’s painting
  
Unconsciously waiting for the end
  
Untethered and drifting towards emptiness

Are we lovers of truth?
  
What you love becomes the cornerstone of your life
  
Your limitations show the glory of the endless
  
The body’s empty vessel must be lost to the waves one day
  
But what remains
  
Holds the sea and sky in its gaze
  
Let the endless breakers roll to the horizon

Where do I begin?
