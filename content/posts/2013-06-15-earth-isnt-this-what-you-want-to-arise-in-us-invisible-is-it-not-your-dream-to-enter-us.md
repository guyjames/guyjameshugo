“

Earth, isn’t this what you want? To arise in us, invisible?

Is it not your dream, to enter us so wholly
  
there’s nothing left outside us to see?

What, if not transformation,
  
is your deepest purpose? Earth, my love,
  
I want it too. Believe me,
  
no more of your springtimes are needed
  
to win me over—even one flower
  
is more than enough. Before I was named
  
I belonged to you. I see no other law
  
but yours, and know I can trust
  
the death you will bring.

See, I live. On what?
  
Childhood and future are equally present.
  
Sheer abundance of being
  
floods my heart.
