“

I am the unknowingness
  
of an unknown mystery.
  
If you want to know something,
  
go elsewhere.
  
If you want to un-know everything,
  
then sit and listen.

The silence inside of you
  
is the sound of your knowledge collapsing.
  
Remember, it is you who said,
  
“I want to be free.&#8221;

”
