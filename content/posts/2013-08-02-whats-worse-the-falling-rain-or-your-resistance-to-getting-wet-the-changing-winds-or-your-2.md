“

What’s worse, the falling rain, or your resistance to getting wet? 

The changing winds, or your battle against them? 

The grass as it grows, or your demand for it to grow faster? 

This moment, or your rejection of it? 

Consider the possibility that Life is never ‘against’ you.

You are Life.
