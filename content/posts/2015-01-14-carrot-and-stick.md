Unfortunately it appears Orwell&#8217;s Nineteen Eighty-Four and Huxley&#8217;s Brave New World were BOTH right! 

BNW is the carrot (consumerism and various drugs) and 1984 is the stick (total surveillance, information management and a hollow &#8216;democracy&#8217;).

We can only hope that the darkest hour is just before the dawn&#8230;
