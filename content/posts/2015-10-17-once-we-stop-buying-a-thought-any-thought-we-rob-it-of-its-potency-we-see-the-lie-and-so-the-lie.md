“Once we stop buying a thought, any thought, we rob it of its potency. We see the lie and so the lie ceases to have any power because the interest and investment just aren’t there anymore. Seeing through just one idea or belief in this way is a revolutionary act. Because if one thought is a lie, then we cannot assume that anything we think is true. Even the idea of ourself as the thinker of thoughts is up for question now. How auspicious!”
