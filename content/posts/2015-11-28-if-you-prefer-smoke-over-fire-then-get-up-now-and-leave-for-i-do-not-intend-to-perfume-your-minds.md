“

If you prefer smoke over fire
  
then get up now and leave.
  
For I do not intend to perfume
  
your mind’s clothing
  
with more sooty knowledge.

No, I have something else in mind.
  
Today I hold a flame in my left hand
  
and a sword in my right.
  
There will be no damage control today.

For God is in a mood
  
to plunder your riches and
  
fling you nakedly
  
into such breathtaking poverty
  
that all that will be left of you
  
will be a tendency to shine.

So don’t just sit around this flame
  
choking on your mind.
  
For this is no campfire song
  
to mindlessly mantra yourself to sleep with.

Jump now into the space
  
between thoughts
  
and exit this dream
  
before I burn the damn place down.
