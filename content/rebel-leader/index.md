&#8216;Rebel Leader&#8217; is my side project for electronic music. My main influences in this kind of music would be people like Brian Eno, Cluster and related Kosmische music, more recent electronica like Boards of Canada, MÃºm, Tranquility Bass, Plaid, FSOL, Four Tet, Burial, Caribou, plus things like Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever and various proggy stuff. Also dub reggae and related like Lee Perry, Adrian Sherwood, On-U-Sound, Augustus Pablo etc.

The idea would be music, not for taking drugs to, but that is in itself a drug. That is the idea, anyway&#8230;

A new album of Rebel Leader music is on its way; watch this space.
