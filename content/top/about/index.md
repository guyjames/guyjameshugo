I live in a seed-form regenerative community of 56ha. in La Garrotxa (Catalonia) called [Les Gavatxes](https://lesgavatxes.cat) which we are in the process of turning into a housing cooperative.

I have been working with the Cooperativa Integral Catalana - you can see me and others talking about it in the documentary [Autogesti√≥](https://enfable.org/autogestio/) - also the Ecoxarxa Garrotxa, and until recently [FairCoop](https://fair.coop).

My main interest is in regenerative solutions to repair the damage done by our destructive default culture, what is known as Game A, and taking steps to implement an alternative, what is called Game B.

Other interests are what might be called Non-Dual Awakening, walking in the mountains, and playing and listening to all kinds of music. If you read some blog entries you will get a picture of what I am up to and what I am into.

I am on Mastodon @guyjames@social.coop
